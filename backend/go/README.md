# Go API Server for openapi

This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of OpenAPI specification
# Introduction
This API definition is intended to to be a good starting point for describing your API in 
[OpenAPI/Swagger format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).
It also demonstrates features of [create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool and 
[Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. So beyond the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few 
[vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

# OpenAPI Specification
The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which
allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source
code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can 
understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what
interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.


## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it openapi
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
